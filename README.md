### Exercise 4
- [x] Basic User Management using Arrays and Loops 
  - [x] What to do: Use arrays and loops to store and manage user data. Implement basic CRUD operations.
  - [x] Expected: CRUD operations like add, delete, update, and display users. Loops should be used for searching through the array to find specific records.

### Exercise 5
- [x] Data Persistence using Basic Java I/O 
  - [x] What to do: Implement functionality to read and write the stored data to a text file. 
  - [x] Expected: Two methods that will save the current user and student data to a text file and read the data back into the program when it starts.

### Exercise 6
- [x] Implement Student and Course Classes with CRUD operations 
  - [x] What to do: Create Student and Course classes. Inside these classes, implement CRUD methods. 
  - [x] Expected: Student and Course classes each having fields for name, ID, etc., and methods for add, update, delete, and display records.

### Exercise 7

  - [x] What to do: Add grading functionality within the Course class. 
  - [x] Expected: Methods inside the Course class that allow the teacher to add or update grades for enrolled students.

### Exercise 8

### Exercise 12
- [x] Incorporate Inheritance and Polymorphism for User Roles 
  - [x] What to do: Extend your user class to have specific roles such as Admin, Teacher, and Student. 
  - [x] Expected: Subclasses for Admin, Teacher, and Student which inherit from a common User class. Use method overriding for role-specific behavior.

### Exercise 15
- [x] Utilize Generics in Methods 
  - [x] What to do: Implement a generic method that can print details of various objects. 
  - [x] Expected: A generic method that takes different object types (like Student or Course) and prints their details.

### Exercise 16
- [x] Annotations and Enums 
  - [x] What to do: Use annotations for documentation and enums for specific constants like user roles. 
  - [x] Expected: Code annotations for methods and enums to represent static data like user roles or course categories.
